# Passage Zero - Agent Operating Context

Last updated: 2026-07-15 (America/Los_Angeles)

This is the living handoff for the greenfield Passage rebuild. Read `AGENTS.md` first, then this file, then `docs/product/persona-action-architecture.md` before changing product code, data contracts, or deployment state.

## Fresh-chat kickoff

Paste this into a new Codex chat:

> Passage Release Train: start the loop. Continue the Passage Zero greenfield rebuild on `thepassageappio/thepassageappio`, branch `greenfield/passage-zero`, draft PR #24. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-operating-context.md`, and `docs/product/persona-action-architecture.md` first. This is a complete rebuild, not a reskin. The funeral director is the primary operating wedge and the QR/no-QR walk-in case-creation experience is the signature moment. Continue without asking Steve for approval except for the genuine gates in `AGENTS.md`. Re-instantiate distinct PM, UX, engineering, QA, and deploy roles and keep the release train moving. Build the shared case/event spine first, then multi-location funeral-home operations, vendor fulfillment, and integration adapters. Verify every shipped batch on desktop and mobile and commit real screenshot evidence.

## Founder mandate

Build Passage as an enterprise-grade coordination operating system for the period before, during, and after a death. The product should combine Apple-like clarity and empathy with serious funeral-home operational depth.

This is a genuine greenfield rebuild. There are no customers and no meaningful migration risk in the current sandbox. Do not preserve old layouts, components, information architecture, terminology, or schema merely because they exist. Preserve only validated product truth and rebuild everything else around the target experience.

The product must be sellable to funeral homes, immediately understandable to directors and employees, calm enough for families in crisis, efficient for vendors, and credible as a scalable company. It must not feel like a checklist app, memorial microsite, generic CRM, or cosmetic wrapper over the legacy application.

### Primary product wedge

The funeral-home director experience is the primary excellence bar and distribution wedge. Passage should become the director's right hand:

- A family walks in with a QR Transfer Pass.
- The director scans it and sees exactly what the family approved for this purpose.
- Passage verifies the handoff, creates the case, assigns the operating location and lead, surfaces the first commitment, and queues future system synchronization.
- If the family has no pass, the director creates a minimal case using only the person and family contact; missing information becomes guided work rather than intake friction.
- No surprises: every action shows actor, recipient or waiting party, timestamp, status, visibility, proof destination, and next action.

The long-term integration goal is to sync this case into existing funeral-home systems through adapters without changing the simple intake UX.

## Experience doctrine

- Zero hand-holding: every persona should understand the menu, next action, status, owner, and outcome immediately.
- No text-heavy pages. Prefer progressive disclosure, clear actions, compact operational summaries, and proof.
- One continuity record connects the family, funeral home, employees, hospice/care providers, cemetery, vendors, participants, estate professionals, support, and system administration.
- Communication belongs to the related task, order, approval, or handoff, not a detached chat stream.
- Families see reassurance, privacy boundaries, one next action, and who is handling what.
- Directors see case flow, risk, ownership, waiting points, staff load, family-update health, vendor state, proof gaps, and recommended action.
- Employees see assigned work, case context, one primary action, prepared communication, proof capture, and escalation.
- Vendors see only scoped opportunities/orders, negotiation, scheduling, payment readiness, and proof, not the broader family record.
- Multi-location organizations need effortless workspace/location switching, employee invites, roles, routing, assignment, templates, reporting, and audit history.
- Visual direction is "warm precision": empathetic, modern, restrained, trustworthy, and enterprise clean. Avoid clinical cobalt, literal dark-tech branding, funeral cliches, card soup, and decorative sentimentality.

## Canonical persona and action architecture

Source: `docs/product/persona-action-architecture.md`.

The target map covers the complete lifecycle and these primary actors:

- Person planning or receiving care
- Family coordinator and additional family members
- Hospice, hospital, senior-living, and care-provider staff
- Funeral-home owner/director
- Funeral-home location manager and employee
- Cemetery/crematory
- Product and service vendors
- Clergy, officiants, celebrants, and other participants
- Estate attorney, executor, financial and property professionals
- Passage support/operations
- System administration and integration actors

Permissions are an intersection of identity, organization, case, role, explicit grant, data category, purpose, workflow state, and time. A role label alone never grants broad case access.

Every meaningful action follows one contract:

1. Actor and authority
2. Case/person context
3. Intended audience or waiting party
4. Minimum data scope
5. Human action and Passage-prepared work
6. State transition
7. Timestamped proof and audit record
8. Clear next action

### Implemented surfaces

- Persona gateway/root
- Funeral director operating view
- Employee work view
- Family coordination journey
- Family Transfer Pass wallet
- Mobile funeral-director Receive/scan experience
- Walk-in director intake at `/director/intake`
- Responsive operations shell and shared warm-precision visual tokens

### Functional walk-in intake slice

The canonical demo record is Sofia Rivera, coordinated by Maya Rivera.

Transfer Pass: `PASS-RIVERA-7K4M`

Created funeral-home case: `NS-2051`

QR path:

1. Open/scan pass.
2. Verify Sofia Rivera, Maya Rivera, expiration, and the four approved information categories.
3. Select operating location and lead director.
4. Create the case.
5. Show the case receipt, first commitment, owner, source, and queued integration state.

No-pass path:

1. Enter the person and family contact only.
2. Select operating location and lead.
3. Create a minimal case.
4. Route missing information into guided case work.

Important boundary: this is a functional client-side sandbox flow. The durable database event model, real authentication/RLS, and external funeral-home-system synchronization are not wired yet. "Sync queued" is demo UI, not a real external integration.

## Visual system

The current palette is "warm precision":

- Canvas `#f7f5f4`
- Surface `#fffcfa`
- Ink `#242128`
- Muted `#6e6671`
- Elderberry/iris signal `#4f46a5`
- Human coral `#e79b80`
- Calm mineral `#bfdce0`
- Success `#2d715e`
- Danger `#a43f46`

Primary contrast checks passed. Coral and mineral are for human/decorative emphasis and soft backgrounds, not white-text action fills.

## Verification evidence

Evidence directory:

https://github.com/thepassageappio/thepassageappio/tree/c4e01c88ae859dbe148fe1274f1d5c612e1d62f1/docs/evidence/passage-zero

Verified:

- Desktop at 1440x1000
- Mobile at 390x844
- QR pass intake through created-case receipt
- No-pass minimal intake
- Director, staff, receive, family, and family-pass mobile regression
- No application console errors in the verified routes
- No horizontal overflow in the verified routes

Each future progress report must include real screenshots. Each real persona slice must be checked at desktop, 390 mobile, and 360 mobile before release.

## Active release train - 2026-07-15

Owner authorized parallel agents and instructed the team to execute without further approval loops.

Active engineering tracks at the time of this handoff:

1. Shared case spine: create a typed sandbox case/event model and make the Sofia Rivera record consistent across family, director, and employee routes.
2. Multi-location funeral-home operations: organization/location switching, employee/team assignment, case ownership, and routing.
3. Vendor fulfillment: scoped opportunity -> accept/negotiate -> confirmed order -> schedule -> completion proof.

Agent runtimes do not transfer to a new chat. The new root agent must inspect the branch and local workspace for any landed work, then re-instantiate incomplete tracks rather than assuming these processes are still alive.

## Next execution sequence

### Batch 1 - shared operational truth

- Define canonical organization, location, team member, case, person, participant, task, message, handoff, order, proof, and audit-event types.
- Use one canonical Sofia Rivera case across family, director, and employee routes.
- Add a client-safe sandbox repository/state layer now; design it so Supabase can replace the storage adapter without rewriting screens.
- Make state changes visible across persona surfaces and preserve actor, audience, timestamp, status, proof, and next action.

### Batch 2 - funeral-home operating system

- Organization onboarding requiring minimal setup.
- Multiple locations and workspace switching.
- Employee invite, role, working hours, skills, assignment, and escalation.
- Case creation, assignment, reassignment, routing rules, templates, family access, communication health, and proof gaps.
- Director "Today" view: cases needing action, unowned waiting, service-date risk, staff load, family communication risk, and recommended next action.
- Employee "My work" view: assigned cases/tasks only, one action at a time, prepared communication, proof capture, escalation.

### Batch 3 - vendor network

- Funeral home requests a scoped service/product from the case.
- Vendor receives an opportunity with minimum required context.
- Accept, decline, or negotiate price/date/scope.
- Confirm an order and expose the same state to the case team.
- Schedule fulfillment, communicate in the order thread, and save completion proof.
- Keep payment state and future billing readiness explicit without inventing pricing or charging real money.

### Batch 4 - durable backend

Before applying schema changes, write a what/why/breakage list as required by `AGENTS.md`.

Expected data domains:

- Organizations, locations, memberships, roles, and routing rules
- Continuity records/cases and persona-scoped case access
- Tasks, dependencies, assignments, waiting states, and proofs
- Case-scoped communication threads and receipts
- Vendor opportunities, negotiations, orders, schedule events, and completion proof
- Transfer Pass tokens, consents, disclosures, scans, acceptances, expiration, and revocation
- Integration connections, outbound jobs, attempts, errors, idempotency keys, and external identifiers
- Append-only audit events

Use real Supabase migrations for structural changes. Do not apply ad hoc production SQL.

### Batch 5 - integration adapter framework

- Stable internal case-creation contract
- Provider-specific adapters behind the contract
- Mapping/version strategy
- Idempotent outbound jobs
- Retry and operator-visible failure states
- Human-readable synchronization proof
- Sandbox/mock adapter for demos before any real vendor integration

## PM Sprint Brief

Status: COMPLETE for the current parallel build batch.

Sprint goal: turn Passage Zero from separate persona demonstrations into one coherent funeral-home-led operating product where a walk-in becomes a shared, assignable case and downstream vendor work stays attached to that case.

Requirements:

- One canonical case and event contract across routes.
- Director-first, zero-hand-holding operating UX.
- Multi-location organization and employee ownership model.
- Vendor negotiation-to-proof state machine.
- Responsive desktop/mobile behavior.
- No unverified legal/compliance claims and no fake external execution.

Acceptance criteria:

- A director can scan a pass or create a minimal walk-in case.
- The resulting case is visible consistently to the allowed family/director/employee personas.
- A director can select location and owner and reassign work.
- A vendor can accept or counter a scoped request, confirm, schedule, and complete it with proof.
- Each transition records actor, time, state, audience, proof destination, and next action.
- Desktop, 390, and 360 have no horizontal overflow or blocking console/hydration errors.
- Real screenshots are committed for every completed persona path.

Dependencies:

- Current Passage Zero App Router application and shared operations shell
- Canonical Sofia Rivera demo fixtures
- GitHub connector for branch writes
- Vercel canonical preview project
- Chrome/browser automation for real visual QA
- Supabase project access before durable migrations

QA/deploy plan:

1. Static TypeScript/component review.
2. Build/lint when a runtime is available; never claim build proof if unavailable.
3. Browser exercise of the complete cross-persona story.
4. Desktop 1440, mobile 390, and mobile 360 checks.
5. Console/hydration/overflow/accessibility checks.
6. Commit screenshot evidence.
7. One coherent preview deployment after the batch is integrated; avoid deploy chains.

Risks:

- Local environment may lack Node/npm/git; use GitHub/Vercel connectors and record verification limits.
- Parallel agents share the filesystem; inspect overlaps before integration.
- Share tokens expire.
- Client-side demo state is not durable or secure; do not confuse it with production readiness.
- Exact legal, compliance, privacy, medical, authority-to-act, HIPAA, FTC Funeral Rule, retention, and disclosure claims require authoritative verification and owner review before product publication.

Non-goals for this batch:

- Charging real money or changing pricing
- Sending real customer/vendor email or SMS
- Claiming real funeral-home-system integration before an adapter exists
- Publishing unverified compliance language
- Production database writes without documented migrations

## Owner gates that remain

Steve has already approved the greenfield rebuild, frontend/backend restructuring, parallel agents, demo deployment, and normal documentation/QA work. Do not ask again for those.

Stop only for the explicit `AGENTS.md` gates:

- Changing pricing amounts
- Sending real customer/vendor/funeral-home email or SMS
- Raw/ad hoc production database SQL
- Deleting functionality rather than deprecating/redirecting
- Material legal, compliance, privacy, security, medical, or funeral-director claims
- Irreversible production data loss
- Spending money or starting paid campaigns

## Required release-train behavior

- Continue PM -> UX -> Development -> QA -> Deploy without pausing when the next action is known.
- Keep roles distinct and record their handoffs.
- Use meaningful batches and preserve the Vercel deploy budget.
- Never report a mockup as shipped product.
- Never report "working," "integrated," "secure," or "enterprise ready" without the matching functional and verification evidence.
- Update this file before final handoff and after each integrated batch.

## Immediate new-chat action

1. Read the three canonical files.
2. Inspect PR #24, the branch head, recent commits, and local `passage-zero/` for parallel-agent changes.
3. Reconcile and review the shared-case, multi-location, and vendor tracks.
4. Integrate the smallest coherent cross-persona story.
5. Run React/Next review, then desktop/mobile browser QA.
6. Commit code and evidence, deploy one preview batch, and update PR #24 plus this context.
7. Auto-advance to the next highest-leverage incomplete product slice.

## Release-train cycle 2 - shared operational truth

Status: COMPLETE and preview verified for this shared-truth batch.

Branch audit:

- PR #24 was inspected at head `5b9ce061ac320aac6b15cc87e95779369c14c201` before this batch.
- The two commits after the last verified code commit contained operating-context and screenshot changes only. None of the previously delegated shared-case, multi-location, or vendor implementation tracks had landed.
- The unfinished tracks were re-instantiated. Product and UX narrowed this batch to the smallest coherent dependency: one shared operational record. Multi-location operations and vendor fulfillment remain queued in that order.

Role handoff record:

- PM: defined Sofia Rivera / Maya Rivera / `PASS-RIVERA-7K4M` / `NS-2051` at Northstar Portland as the canonical scenario, with Elena Torres accountable and Marcus Lee assigned. Required an idempotent browser-persistent sandbox event spine; excluded multi-location, vendor, and Supabase work from this batch.
- UX: passed the concept with conditions that one event be translated by persona, family and staff boundaries remain explicit, every mutation preserve actor/time/audience/waiting/proof/next owner, sandbox-only execution be disclosed, and desktop plus 390/360 layouts be verified.
- Development: implemented typed commands, events, fixture state, a replaceable local-storage adapter, a React provider, and cross-persona issue/inspect/accept/start/proof/revoke/reset flows. Director intake, director case, staff work, family pass, and receiver surfaces now read and mutate the same canonical record.
- QA: first review failed on selectable destination divergence, premature director actions, ambiguous manual-draft state, staff navigation leakage, ownership wording, and receipt-link behavior. Those issues were fixed. Focused static QA then passed.

Verification evidence:

- TypeScript verification passed after integration.
- Final TypeScript verification and the optimized production Next.js build passed after integration and the warning-only layout adjustment.
- Browser QA exercised family issue -> receiver inspection -> acceptance into `NS-2051` -> director start -> staff proof -> director/family proof return.
- Runtime state persisted after reload. Revoked, expired, already-accepted, and invalid pass outcomes preserved a no-disclosure boundary.
- Mobile checks at nominal 390 and 360 widths had equal document client and scroll widths with no horizontal overflow.
- Browser evidence is stored under `docs/evidence/passage-zero/shared-*.png`.
- The sandbox is explicitly browser-local and is not durable, secure, multi-user, or production backend evidence.

Preview handoff:

- QA-approved commit: `f4ba31321474fbdf4620aeadc888460c914c236b`.
- Vercel deployment: `dpl_6o3NivMoyE93XY8woguxpLMQu9Yn` (`READY`, Next.js/Turbopack, preview target).
- Stable branch alias: `https://thepassageappio-git-green-4c1c26-thepassageappio-7018s-projects.vercel.app`.
- Temporary share token generated for the July 15 demo expires July 16, 2026.
- The family/D2C journey is viable for next-week guided testing, including urgent and planning-ahead positioning, but self-serve SaaS readiness still requires authentication, durable cross-device records, account recovery, subscriptions, notifications, and production authorization.

Integrated files and contracts:

- `lib/sandbox/types.ts`, `repository.ts`, and `provider.tsx` define the shared contract and storage seam.
- `lib/passage-zero.ts` and `components/PassageZeroProvider.tsx` expose the shared slice to the App Router.
- Family, receive, director intake, director case, and staff routes now project persona-appropriate views of the same events.
- Multi-location organization switching, employee administration, vendor negotiation/fulfillment, durable Supabase persistence, and real integrations remain intentionally unimplemented.

Next execution sequence after preview verification:

1. Re-instantiate PM and UX for the multi-location funeral-home operating slice.
2. Preserve the shared event spine and add organization/location/membership/assignment concepts without widening family access.
3. Run the same static -> browser -> evidence -> single-preview loop.
4. Advance vendor fulfillment only after location and ownership semantics are coherent.
